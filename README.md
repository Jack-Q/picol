## Picol as Pico-Language

> 1 Pico-L is 10<sup>-12</sup>L, a tiny volume that can hold only a small neuron.

In this project, a minimal C-like language is to be implemented for demonstrative purpose.
Since the language is so trivial that it is inadequate for any real world application,
this language is named as PicoL(Pico-Language, where "pico-" is 10<sup>-12</sup>).
