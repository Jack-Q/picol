## Picol as Pico-Language

> 1 Pico-L is 10<sup>-12</sup>L, a tiny volume that can hold only a small neuron.

In the first stage of this project, a minimal C-like language is to be implemented.
Since the language is so small that it is inadequate for any real world application,
this language is named as PicoL(Pico-Language, where "pico-" is 10<sup>-12</sup>).

## Picol as Pictorial Illustrated Compiler Organization by Layer

> This module is currently under planning

Pictorial Illustrated Compiler Organization by Layer is a serials of interactive 
applications that illustrates the construction of a simple compiler
(of the PicoL).
